        Resources that are used in computer device production include silica, iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, lead, selenium, arsenic, tin, nickel, and cadmium.
        Additionally, computer device production will lead to more computers being thrown away which causes e-waste.</td>

        Often, this energy is retrieved from burning fossil fuels which releases greenhouse gas emissions.
        These gases trap heat in our atmosphere and are one of the causes of climate change, an example would be carbon dioxide. </td>
